# Virtual-Reality---CS-4331---Project-2
This is a join project between Saif Chowdhury, Rishabh Tewari, Joshua Fryar, and Junwoo Jang. The goal is to create an "innovative" VR experience using interesting and unorthodox controls that hadn't been used before.

In order to access this game on Unity - click the add button -> select the whole folder -> then in the assets tab click -> Scense - > then double click "So Far" the other scenes are just previous versions.

Click "developement" folder to see images of the game in progress.

Update: so the developement photo actually doesn't let you see, or preview the images I posted.

However, this is the video of our completed game that I never got around to uploading on github but here it is:
